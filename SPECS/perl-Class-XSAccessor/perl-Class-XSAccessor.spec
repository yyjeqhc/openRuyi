%description
Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write accessors in
XS. Additionally, it can provide predicates such as has_foo() for testing
whether the attribute foo exists in the object (which is different from "is
defined within the object"). It only works with objects that are
implemented as ordinary hashes. Class::XSAccessor::Array implements the
same interface for objects that use arrays for their internal
representation.
