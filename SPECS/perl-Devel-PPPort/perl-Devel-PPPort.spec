%description
Perl's API has changed over time, gaining new features, new functions,
increasing its flexibility, and reducing the impact on the C namespace
environment (reduced pollution). The header file written by this module,
typically ppport.h, attempts to bring some of the newer Perl API features
to older versions of Perl, so that you can worry less about keeping track
of old releases, but users can still reap the benefit.
