%description
Here is the primary use case: you have several long texts (and/or binary
blobs) that you wish to load from the code (e.g: for the "want"/expected
values of tests) and you wish to conventiently edit them, track them and
maintain them. Using Dir::Manifest you can put each in a separate file in a
directory, create a manifest file listing all valid filenames/key and then
say something like my $text = $dir->text("deal24solution.txt", {lf => 1}).
And hopefully it will be done securely and reliably.
