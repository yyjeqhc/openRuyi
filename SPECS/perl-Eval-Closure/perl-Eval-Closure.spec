%description
String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose
uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and
constructors, which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount.
String eval is not without its issues however - it's difficult to control
the scope it's used in (which determines which variables are in scope
inside the eval), and it's easy to miss compilation errors, since eval
catches them and sticks them in $@ instead.
