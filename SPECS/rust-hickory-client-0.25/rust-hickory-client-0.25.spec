This is the Client library with DNSSEC support.  DNSSEC with NSEC validation for negative records, is complete. The client supports  dynamic DNS with SIG0 authenticated requests, implementing easy to use high level  functions. Hickory DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means  it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those  libraries.
