Eventually this could be a replacement for BIND9. The DNSSEC support allows  for live signing of all records, in it does not currently support  records signed offline. The server supports dynamic DNS with SIG0 authenticated  requests. Hickory DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means  it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those  libraries.

Additionally, this package also provides the "blocklist" feature.

Eventually this could be a replacement for BIND9. The DNSSEC support allows  for live signing of all records, in it does not currently support  records signed offline. The server supports dynamic DNS with SIG0 authenticated  requests. Hickory DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means  it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those  libraries.
