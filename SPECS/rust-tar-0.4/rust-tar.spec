%description -n %{name}+xattr
This library does not currently handle compression, but it is abstract over all I/O readers and writers. Additionally, great lengths are taken to ensure that the entire contents are never required to be entirely resident in memory all at once.
This metapackage enables feature "xattr" for the Rust tar crate, by pulling in any additional dependencies needed by that feature.

Additionally, this package also provides the "default" feature.
