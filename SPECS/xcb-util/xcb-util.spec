%description
The XCB util modules provide a number of libraries which sit on top
of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

Included in this package are:

- atom: Standard core X atom constants and atom caching.
- aux: Convenient access to connection setup and some core requests.
- event: Callback X event handling.
